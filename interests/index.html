          <h2>Dungeons and Dragons</h2>
          <p>
            Something that I"ve picked up when I went to college was Dungeons and Dragons, or DnD
            for short. I was introduced to this game in my first year of college, and I've played
            nearly every weekend since then. If you'd like a brief explanation of what DnD is,
            here's a 5 minute video explaining DnD for absolute beginners.

          <h2>Fitness</h2>
          <p>
            When I was younger, I was not very active and very skinny, leaving me with self esteem
            issues growing up. When I reached high school, I started working out, where I started
            seeing myself progress more and more throughout my high school career. While I wasn't
            as strong as mypeers, I was happy to see improvement with myself, which is why I
            continued to workout, until COVID hit. One pandemic later, I lost my motivation to              continue to go to the gym, and going into college, I'd occasionally go, but not at a
            consistent rate to see growth in myself. This year, currently my second year, I've
            gone every day, and while I'm not at the same spot as I was last year, I've loved
            seeing improvement in myself while I go to the gym everyday.
