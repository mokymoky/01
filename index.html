        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <ul>
          <p>
            Hello, my name is Nathan Ahn. I am a second year student at Illinois Institute of
            Technology, studying Information Technology Management. I've been surrounded by
            computers almost my entire life, so I've taken an interest in learning about them. This
            curiosity led me to my major, where I've learned even more about the computers I use,
            along with the supplementary subjects that go alongside computing, such as networking,
            coding, and data structures. Thanks to my time in IIT, I've met great teachers that
            continue to push that passion for Information Technology further, supporting it through
            their own passion.</p>

        <h2>About this Website</h2>
        <ul>
          <p>
            This website was made in HTML, to show off my own web design skills, though at this
            point and time, it's still at a beginner's level. It's also a showcase of my own personal
            hobbies and interest, along with a showcase of my resume for any future employers, or
            recruiters.
