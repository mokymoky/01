          <p>
            This website was made in HTML, to show off my own web design skills, though at this
            point and time, it's still at a beginner's level. On top of that, it shows some of my
            own personal projects, along with my own hobbies and interests for those interested.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those Personal Projects include
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Java/Python Programs</li>
            <li>HTML web design</li>
            <li>Drawing Projects</li>
            <li>Anything that I want to show people</li>
